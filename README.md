# awesome-GAFAM
Awesome-GAFAM is a tutorial to escape (a bit) the influence of GAFAM on your life.
Each step in this list is optionnal and can be skipped if you think it's too much pain.
(But you definitely should follow most :) )

## 1. Simple steps

The first step to escape GAFAM is to change some of your everyday softwares that are tracking you.
This migration should be painless and can greatly improve your privacy!

### 1.1. Browsing the internet

If you belong to the 63.5% of people using Google Chrome, good news! Simply removing it will greatly increase your privacy.
There are tons of alternatives out there but I will advise sticking with an open-source web browser.
Two popular choices are **Mozilla Firefox** and **Chromium**, the latter being the closest to your Google Chrome experience.
**Brave** is also a browser based on privacy that you might want to check.

| Name | Link | Importing bookmarks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mozilla Firefox | [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download/thanks/) | [this](https://www.howtogeek.com/810747/import-chrome-bookmarks-to-firefox/) tutorial |
| Chromium | [here](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/) | [this](https://techwiser.com/export-bookmarks-from-google-chrome/) tutorial |
| Brave | [here](https://brave.com/linux/#release-channel-installation) | [this](https://techwiser.com/export-bookmarks-from-google-chrome/) tutorial |

Of course if you are on linux you can install the `firefox` or the `chromium-browser` packages.
Brave installation on Linux is a bit more complex by very acceptable.

The next step is to change your **search engine**. Several search engines are focused on privacy (list [here](https://restoreprivacy.com/private-search-engine/)), but I will advise a few.
**DuckDuckGo** has an interface very close to Google and has great search results.
**Qwant** is a bit different but adopting it should still be a breeze. And Brave comes with its own search engine.

To change your default search engine on *Firefox*, click on the three bars on the to right > Setting > Search > then you can change the search engine.
